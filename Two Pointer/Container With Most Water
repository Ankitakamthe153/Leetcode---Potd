//Approach-2 (Two pointer Greedy (O(N)) (It's similar to Approach-1)
//Just that we are eliminating heights at one go

            int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
            int w = j-i;
            int area = h*w;
            water = max(water, area);
            
            //Then move towards large one because we can have better answer
            if(height[i] <
            while(i < j && height[i] <= h)
                i++;
            //Same,  move towards large one because we can have better answer
            while(i < j && height[j] <= h)
                j--;
        }
        
        return water;
    }
